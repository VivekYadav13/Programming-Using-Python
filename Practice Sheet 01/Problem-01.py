'''
Write a program that examines three variables - x, y, and z - and prints the largest odd number among them. If none of them are odd, it should print a message to that effect.

x, y, z = int(input("Enter first number: ")), int(
    input("Enter second number: ")), int(input("Enter third number: "))
n = 0
