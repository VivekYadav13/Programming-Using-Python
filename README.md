# Programming-Using-Python

This is a repository that I have created to store basic Python codes that I have written as part of my degree course. These codes can be used as a reference for anyone who wants to learn Python or as a resource for anyone who wants to understand the basic concepts of programming.

## Getting Started

To use the codes in this repository, you need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website of Python. Although optional, but you can also install an IDE or a code editor. You may code from the web too.

## Contents

This repository contains various Python codes that cover the following topics:

- Data types
- Variables
- Loops
- Conditional statements
- Functions
- Data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries)

Each practice sheet covers a new topic and some topics from the past. The codes are well-documented and easy to understand with question given along each code.

## Contributing

Everybody is a learner. It is highly possible that some of my codes can be inefficient. If you want to contribute to this repository, you can fork this repository, make changes to the codes, and create a pull request. I welcome all contributions that can improve the quality of the codes in this repository. Alternatively, you can just create an issue to notify me about the problem.
