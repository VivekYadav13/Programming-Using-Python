Another series that can calculate pi is the Nilakantha series. It is a little more complicated to calculate, but gets close to pi much faster than does the Gregory- Leibniz series of Exercise 9. The Nilakantha series is:
PI = 3 + 4/(2*3*4) - 4/(4*5*6) + 4/(6*7*8) âˆ’ 4/(8*9*10) ...
Calculate the first 15 terms of this series. How many digits of pi are correct?

        j += 1
    return val
